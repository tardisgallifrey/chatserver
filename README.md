# Java Chat Server
This project uses Java Sockets to create a chat server.  While it works, it's a bit of a kluge.

I haven't written it well enough for real use yet, but it operates well at the moment.  

The server merely reflects the client message back at the client.

This is written for Intellij IDE.  Javarun and Javarun.bat will run the file after building (linux and windows respectively).

As always, use at your own risk.
